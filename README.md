# Magisk-Modules-PixelFonts-Android-10
If you want vanilla font reading experiences by Google, this is what you whant.

Apply this zip as a magisk module, and you have universal reading experiences no matter the version of Android or the phone you bought.

Alternatively, You can try the htc10Fonts-Android 8.0.zip for Android 8.0 font reading experiences, if the new font fallback behavior added in Android 9 for your language variant is undesirable to you.
